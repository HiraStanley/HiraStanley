## 🌸 About Me
I am a data scientist with a background in finance, driven by the challenge of solving complex, meaningful problems using data. I enjoy building full-stack, production-ready solutions that make an impact—from conversational AI and time series forecasting to computer vision and recommendation systems.

My work blends statistical rigor, machine learning, and cross-functional collaboration to generate actionable insights and build scalable solutions. I especially enjoy projects that drive social impact.

When I’m not working with data, you can find me exploring new countries, learning languages, or diving into a good book.
