## üìÇ Featured Projects

### Traditional Machine Learning
- **Diabetes Risk Prediction**  
  Built and tuned classification models to predict early diabetes risk using CDC survey data. Achieved an F1-score of 0.77 and recall of 0.80 to prioritize minimizing missed diagnoses. Applied SHAP to interpret model drivers such as blood pressure, BMI, and age.

- **Verizon Customer Default Risk Prediction**  
  Developed a Random Forest classifier to predict customer churn at account creation, achieving 91% accuracy. Enabled targeted retention strategies that generated an estimated $536M revenue uplift per 1M applicants.

- **eCommerce Bookstore Recommendation Engine**  
  Created a recommendation system using RFM-based K-Means customer segmentation. Personalized marketing workflows led to $545K in incremental revenue through tailored offers.

### Time Series Forecasting
- **Ecolab Time Series Forecasting Project**  
  Developed a time series anomaly detection model for commercial equipment failure, improving early detection and reducing false alarms in operational settings.

- **NYC Air Quality Index Forecasting**  
  Engineered and compared Na√Øve, Seasonal Na√Øve, ARIMA, SARIMA, and SARIMAX models using 25 years of Manhattan AQI data. The final SARIMAX model achieved the lowest RMSE (14.6) and revealed wind speed as a key driver for pollution mitigation strategies.

### Computer Vision
- **Floor Plan Object Detection and Inpainting**  
  Built a full-stack system that detects objects in 2D floor plans, reconstructs 3D layouts, and enables text-guided customization using Stable Diffusion inpainting. Deployed object detection and segmentation pipelines for automated scene rendering.
  
- **Yoga Pose Classification**  
  Designed and trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify 107 yoga poses with validation accuracy up to 70% using transfer learning (EfficientNet). Developed a live web app using quantized TFLite models.

- **BMI Estimation from Facial Images**  
  Built a deep learning-based computer vision pipeline to estimate BMI from facial images. Fine-tuned VGG-Face and VGG-Net models, achieving a validation MAE of 4.7 BMI points. Further improved predictions using ensemble regression models.

### Agentic AI & NLP
- **Ecolab Conversational Agent**  
  Developed a Databricks agent to assist with troubleshooting and equipment diagnostics by vectorizing documentation related to broken parts and repair procedures. Enabled semantic search and retrieval to improve response accuracy for client-facing support.


- **EarlySignal: GeoHealth Outbreak Monitor**  
  Led a capstone team to build a mobile-ready conversational agent for real-time illness reporting and geotagged outbreak alerts. Designed and deployed agent-based orchestration and end-to-end pipelines for public health monitoring.
